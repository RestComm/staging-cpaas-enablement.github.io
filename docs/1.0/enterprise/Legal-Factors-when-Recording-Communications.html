It is imperative for you to familiarize yourself with the laws, regulations, and industry standards specific to you, so that you can record calls in a legally compliant manner.  There are numerous laws and regulations that are triggered when recording a “call,” which includes any spoken communications between two or more participants.  General information about recording is presented herein.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of using our Services, <span class="sps-text non-sps-link" data-orig-text="CPaaS" data-parm-text="company_name" data-default-text="$INFER_FROM_DOMAIN">CPaaS</span> requires that its customers comply with all applicable laws and statutes.  Consent is different from location to location.  It is the best practice to comply with the most restrictive consent laws and obtain consent from all participants on the call prior to recording or storing a call.  You should provide a clear explanation to all participants on the call that you may or will record a call.  Further, you should disclose to all participants on the call that you may or will record and store these communications.  You should store your call recording with the appropriate leave of security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can obtain consent in a number of ways, depending upon the nature of the call and/or the call participants.  A typical way to obtain to consent is to play a message <strong>before</strong> the call is recording indicating that the call will be recorded and/or stored.  You should keep records of how you obtain consent, and how you plan to use and/or store any recordings.  You should only store and use the recording in a manner consistent with what you told the participants.  If the participant does not consent to the recording, you should not record the call.  There are other ways to obtain consent, which you should discuss in detail with your legal counsel who is familiar with your jurisdiction.</p>

<h2 id="_laws_relating_to_call_recordings"><a class="anchor" href="#_laws_relating_to_call_recordings"></a>Laws Relating to Call Recordings</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are different laws and regulations at both the federal and state level in the United States that relate to recording calls, including, but not limited to, California’s Invasion of Privacy Act (“CIPA”), Cal. Penal Code §§ 630 et seq., and similar laws.  You are required to obtain consent by one/two/or all participants before you can record a call, by certain federal and state laws. At least 10 other states in the United States require you to obtain consent by all parties before you record a call.  There are laws outside the United States that require you to also obtain the consent of the call participants before you may record a call, such as the EU’s GDPR.  In addition to the requirements on obtaining consent, there may also be laws, regulations, or industry standards that indicate how you may use, disclose, store, and secure you call recordings.  You should discuss in detail these additional factors, specific to you and your business, with your legal counsel who is familiar with your jurisdiction.</p>
